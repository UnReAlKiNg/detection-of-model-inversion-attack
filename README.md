The <L2_norm> fold contains graphs of l2-norm value for number 0-9 with their first 300 iterations.
  
The <cosine_similarity> fold contains graphs of cosine similarity value for number 0-9 with their first 300 iterations.

The <MIFace_MNIST(CIFAR10).ipynb> is the file that applies MI attack on MNIST(CIFAR10) dataset.

The <myvgg11_cifar10.ipynb>vis the file that trains a vgg11 network to classify CIFAR10 dataset.
  
The <detector.ipynb> is using combined method to detect MI attack and save record to .csv file.
